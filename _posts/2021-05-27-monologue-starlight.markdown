# Monologue: ( Starlight)

![Monologue: ( Starlight)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49949411/120108190-b15f4c80-c196-11eb-8635-75161e46faaa.jpeg)

The sun is getting down

The melody of the night is near me

You still look far away

What are you searching for,dear?

You keep running away from me,

You keep loosing yourself with that

Do you afraid yourself?

Stop being a coward

Take my hand and work hard

You will reach your aim

Being afraid of unknown is okay

Being afraid of difficulties is normal,too

But anyway you need to look inside your heart

And to believe in yourself

Maybe it's hard for you to put yourself

On the right place

But you should not be afraid of doing a step

Even if it's a wrong one,

Don't be afraid,

I'll be by your side

And we'll overcome that

You keep running away from me,

You keep loosing yourself with that

Do you afraid to lose?

Stop being a coward

Take my hand, I'll be with you.

It's already dark,

But do you see the stars on the sky?

You keep running away from me,

You keep loosing yourself with that

Let's make a step toward the setting sun

And we will see the night full of stars.
